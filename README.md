# What is this?
  Ophenium I is my first Discord bot. I started this project without much of an idea of the kinds of things I want him to be able to do, so the future is very open. Perhaps he'll only be a music bot, or maybe I'll add in role sorting too. Who knows?

# What does it do?
  As of now, mostly music stuff. I've got a file named [features.txt](https://github.com/tmorgan181/ophenium1/blob/master/features.txt) that lists potential additions and current features of Ophenium. In general he can:
    -Perform commands of varying usefulness
    -Join and leave voice channels
    -Create a queue of music and play it
    -Manipulate the queue and music stream
