# What is this?
  Ophenium I is my first Discord bot. I started this project without much of an idea of the kinds of things I want him to be able to do, so the future is very open.

# What does he do?
  As of now, mostly music stuff. I've got a file named [features.txt](https://github.com/tmorgan181/ophenium1/blob/master/features.txt) that lists potential additions and current features of Ophenium. In general he can:
  
    -Perform commands of varying usefulness (Ping/Pong, Say hi, etc.)
    
    -Create, manipulate, and play a stream of music in a chat channel
    
    -Play Gem Jam, a gem-collecting game based on the Webkinz minigame "Gem Hunt"
