# What is this?
Ophenium I is my first Discord bot, written in JavaScript.

# What does he do?
I've got a file named [features.txt](https://github.com/tmorgan181/ophenium1/blob/master/features.txt) that lists potential additions and current features of Ophenium. In general he can:
  
    -Perform commands of varying usefulness (Ping/Pong, Say hi, etc.)
    
    -Create, manipulate, and play a stream of music in a chat channel
    
    -Play Gem Jam, a gem-collecting game based on the Webkinz minigame "Gem Hunt"
