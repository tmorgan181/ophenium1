# What is this?
  Ophenium I is my first Discord bot. It'll probably be bad, but yaknow :shrug:

# What does it do?
  Uhhh... well... not much now. But maybe more soon? idk. In any case I've got a file named [features.txt](https://github.com/tmorgan181/ophenium1/blob/master/features.txt) that is just a list of potential additions and current features (which at the moment is not very many lol). That'll hopefully get longer as time goes on. As for the general stuff he can:
    -Perform commands of varying usefulness
    -Join and leave voice channels
    -Create a queue of music and play it (kinda... there's some bugs noted in features.txt)
