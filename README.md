# Ophenium I
Ophenium I is my first Discord bot, written in JavaScript.

# Description
Ophenium I has several available functions of ranging utility. My main focus at the start of development was to create a music manager that could queue up and play audio from Youtube video sources. I eventually branched out and began working on a text-based gem collection game called Gem Jam, which has since been the main feature.

In general Ophenium I can:
  
    -Create, manipulate, and play a stream of music in a chat channel

    -Play Gem Jam, a gem-collecting game based on the Webkinz minigame "Gem Hunt"

    -Perform commands of varying usefulness (Ping/Pong, Say hi, etc.)

For a full list of Ophenium's features (both present and planned), see [features.txt](https://github.com/tmorgan181/ophenium1/blob/master/features.txt).
