#FEATURES

  CURRENT
    Command System
      -This is the basis of Ophenium I (in theory), where most functions can be
       accessed
      -List of available commands:
          !help [command]   //Lists commands and their descriptions or gives a
                              detailed explanation of [command]
          !howdy            //Says partner back
          !join             //Joins the caller's voice channel
          !leave            //Leaves the caller's voice channel
          !ping             //Says pong! back
          !shout [message]  //only kinda works, output LOOKS,LIKE,THIS when it
                              should LOOK LIKE THIS

  PLANNED

      -Channel creator/manager
      -Some other useful stuff

  KNOWN BUGS
    -There's less of them now! But the list will inevitably grow again
        -!shout command doesn't handle multi-word messages as desired
            ex) `!shout hello world` becomes "HELLO,WORLD"

  FIXED BUGS
    -!leave works as intended now! How exciting!
    -!join now has a check to make sure the user and bot are not in the same
     voice channel
