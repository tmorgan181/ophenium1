#FEATURES

  CURRENT
    Command System
      -This is the basis of Ophenium I (in theory), where most functions can be
       accessed
      -List of available commands:
          !help [command]   //Lists commands and their descriptions or gives a
                              detailed explanation of [command]
          !howdy            //Says partner back
          !join             //Joins the caller's voice channel
          !leave            //Leaves the caller's voice channel
          !ping             //Says pong! back
          !shout [message]  //only kinda works, output LOOKS,LIKE,THIS when it
                              should LOOK LIKE THIS

  PLANNED
    Random Stuff
      -Grab pictures from the internet and post them or something

      -this is it chief (whatever that means)

    Maybe Long Road
      -Role sort
      -Channel creator/manager
      -Some other useful stuff
      -Probably something about mods are gay, thanks automod very cool

  KNOWN BUGS
    -There's lots of them. Surprise surprise lol.
        -!shout command doesn't handle multi-word messages as desired
            ex) `!shout hello world` becomes "HELLO,WORLD"
        -!leave command can be issued and executed from any channel, not just
         the one that Ophenium I is connected to
        -There's no response/check if !join is called while bot is in the same
         voice channel (seems that a lot of my headache comes from not knowing
         how to find the id of the connected voice channel lol)
