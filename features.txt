          create            //Create a new player profile
          mine              //Go mining for gems in one of the four mines

  KNOWN BUGS
    Music
      -Queues are separate for different guilds, but !play doesn't work if !play
       was called first in a different guild

    Misc
      -My GCP instance doesn't seem to like Ophenium very much. But that's not a
       huge problem rn so I probs won't fix it for a while

  FIXED BUGS
    01/31/19 - 02/01/19
      -!leave works as intended now! How exciting!
      -!join now has a check to make sure the user and bot are not in the same
      voice channel
      -!shout works as intended

    02/03/19
      -!play plays all the songs in the queue now and doesn't crash Ophenium if
       music is already playing
      -!stop, !skip, etc. added
