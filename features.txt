      -Gem Jam is a fun little gem collecting game, based on the classic Webkinz
       game Gem Hunt

      Commands (all of which begin with the `!gemJam` prefix)

          shop              //Shop for cool items with coins

  PLANNED
    Currently Working On
      -Gem Jam: shop and sell, trading system?
      -Gem Jam: confirm before removing profile and selling gem (use
       lastmessage.id?)

    Backburner
      -Add music info command to get song name, channel, etc (gonna need to
       replace ytdl with something else i think)
      -Search function for music instead of links (karl knows how?)

    Random Stuff
      -Grab pictures from the internet and post them or something
      -this is it chief (whatever that means)

    Maybe Later?
      -Role sort
      -Channel creator/manager
      -Some other useful stuff
      -Probably something about mods are gay, thanks automod very cool

  KNOWN BUGS
    Music
      -Queues are separate for different guilds, but !play doesn't work if !play
       was called first in a different guild

    Gem Jam
      -No known bugs

    Misc
      -My GCP instance doesn't seem to like Ophenium very much. But that's not a
       huge problem rn so I probs won't fix it for a while

  FIXED BUGS
    01/31/19 - 02/01/19
      -!leave works as intended now! How exciting!
      -!join now has a check to make sure the user and bot are not in the same
      voice channel
      -!shout works as intended

    02/03/19
      -!play plays all the songs in the queue now and doesn't crash Ophenium if
       music is already playing
      -!stop, !skip, etc. added
