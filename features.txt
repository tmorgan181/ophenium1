#FEATURES

  CURRENT
    Command System
      -This is the basis of Ophenium I (in theory), where most functions can be
       accessed
      -List of available commands:
          !help [command]   //Lists commands and their descriptions or gives a
                              detailed explanation of [command]
          !howdy            //Says partner back
          !join             //Joins the caller's voice channel
          !leave            //Leaves the caller's voice channel
          !play [link]      //Plays [link] in the connected voice channel (note:
                              currently only works with youtube links)
          !ping             //Says pong! back
          !shout [message]  //Sends [message] in all caps

  PLANNED
    Random Stuff
      -Grab pictures from the internet and post them or something
      -this is it chief (whatever that means)

    Maybe Long Road
      -Role sort
      -Channel creator/manager
      -Some other useful stuff
      -Probably something about mods are gay, thanks automod very cool

  KNOWN BUGS
    Music
      -Songs cannot be queued, running !play twice in a row crashes bot (but hey
       at least it can play one song)
      -Not really a bug, but there's no !stop command, so in order to make the
       bot quit playing audio, must use !leave

  FIXED BUGS
    01/31/19 - 02/01/19
      -!leave works as intended now! How exciting!
      -!join now has a check to make sure the user and bot are not in the same
      voice channel
      -!shout works as intended
