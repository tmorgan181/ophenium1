#FEATURES

  CURRENT
    Command System
      -This is the basis of Ophenium I (in theory), where most functions can be
       accessed
      -List of available commands:
          !help [command]   //Lists commands and their descriptions or gives a
                              detailed explanation of [command]
          !howdy            //Says partner back
          !join             //Joins the caller's voice channel
          !leave            //Leaves the caller's voice channel
          !play             //Plays the first song in the queue if there is one
          !queue [link]     //Adds [link] to the back of the queue
          !ping             //Says pong! back
          !shout [message]  //Sends [message] in all caps

  PLANNED
    Near Future
      -Add skip, stop, and clear queue commands for music
      -Add music info command to get song name, channel, etc (gonna need to
       replace ytdl with something else i think)

    Random Stuff
      -Grab pictures from the internet and post them or something
      -this is it chief (whatever that means)

    Maybe Long Road
      -Role sort
      -Channel creator/manager
      -Some other useful stuff
      -Probably something about mods are gay, thanks automod very cool

  KNOWN BUGS
    Music
      -Using !play only plays the first song in the queue (non-fatal bug)
      -Using !play while a song is playing crashes the bot
      -Not really a bug, but there's no !stop command, so in order to make the
       bot quit playing audio, must use !leave
       
    Misc
      -My GCP instance doesn't seem to like Ophenium very much

  FIXED BUGS
    01/31/19 - 02/01/19
      -!leave works as intended now! How exciting!
      -!join now has a check to make sure the user and bot are not in the same
      voice channel
      -!shout works as intended
